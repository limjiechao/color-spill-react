# Color Spill React!

Color Spill is an addictive casual game where the player starts with a grid beautifully populated with squares in random colors and strives to fill the entire grid with one color before running out of steps.

## What's New

Color Spill React! is the successor to my [WDI Project #1: Color Spill!](https://github.com/limjiechao/project-1)

It is completely rethought and revamped under the hood:
- Fast and efficient DOM refresh with *React*.
- New, non-recursive color filling algorithm using simple logic even kids can understand.
- Color filling algorithm is constructed with JavaScript built-in objects like maps, sets, one-dimensional arrays and associative arrays (objects).
- CSS-only responsive resizing using, `vh`, `vw`, default wrapping and alignment behavior of flexbox.
